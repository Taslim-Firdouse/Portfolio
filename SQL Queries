Working on KPMG Virtual Internship 
There are three files shared, I used nested Join to combine three files on the primary key customer_id

-- Nested Join
Select * from transactions tr
Join (customerdemo cd, customeraddress ca)
on (tr.customer_id= cd.customer_id AND tr.customer_id= ca.customer_id);
